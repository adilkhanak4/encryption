# 🔐 Python Encryption & Decryption Solution

This project is a simple **file encryption and decryption system developed using Python**.  
It helps in protecting sensitive text data by converting it into an unreadable encrypted format and then restoring it back to its original form using decryption.

The project works by reading data from a text file, encrypting it using a secret key, and saving the encrypted content into another file. Using the same key, the encrypted file can be decrypted back to its original readable form.
